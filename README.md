# twitter-extension
**About:** This is a twitter extension that removes distraction from your home feed, the unwanted trending sidebar, and the videos, which is completely useless in a web version in `explore` page. So, this is a youtube video: TODO that showcases about how to download and install it on your machine, remember this twitter extension only works on chrome browser only. I haven't scaled yet or release yet on chrome web store so this is somewhat painful if you ain't a developer. TLDR to the youtube video.<br/>

**STEPS:** <br/>

**Step 1:** Clone this repository. Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), then go to your terminal, in case if you use Windows, search Git, and open it in CLI. Type `git clone https://github.com/tausiq2003/twitter-extension.git`.<br/>

**Step 2:** Remove the `.git` folder. Go to that folder that you have cloned, via CLI or GUI. Delete the `.git` folder.<br/>
**Step 3:** Now as your extension is ready to execute, open up your CHROME browser(yes, its only available on Google Chrome only), on the top of URL bar, type `chrome://extensions` and press Enter. Turn on Developer options.<br/>
**Step 4:** Now, you will see the Load Unpacked button, after turning on the Developer Mode, go to `chrome://extensions` and click on Load Unpacked button and select the folder that you have git cloned.<br/>
**Step 5:** Now your extension is ready to use. Pin the extension and enjoy :). If there is any issues or problems or bugs in the extension. Screenshot your console bar of webpage and extension as shown in video and raise an issue, or you can raise an issue and we can follow on.<br/>
## Thank You for using my extension. ü§ù
